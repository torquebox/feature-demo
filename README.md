# TorqueBox 4 feature demo

This app provides small, useful examples of TorqueBox 4 API usage.

## Usage

With JRuby installed and in your $PATH, run:

    $ bundle install
    $ torquebox run

You'll see lots of output as the various TorqueBox features are
exercised. You can see the basic web request echoer at
http://localhost:8080/ and the simple [sockjs](http://sockjs.org) chat
service at http://localhost:8080/sockjs.
